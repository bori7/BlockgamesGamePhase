### Deployed product

 -- https://nestcoin_appadmin_new.surge.sh/

### Task Description

Nestcoin is a film house that would like to further engage with their audience.
They would like to create a "currency", which would be used to reward loyal customers. The currency could later be traded for backstage passes and other perks. Interestingly they began accepting crypto-based payments a year earlier and would like to harness the power of Web3 to implement their solution.
You and your team have been tasked with developing a solution. You will also be required to develop a system that allows them to batch transactions together so they can distribute their "currency" as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Your token/currency smart contract should support fungible tokens. The "currency" should be fungible and interchangeable (e.g USD).
Customers should not have to claim their rewards. They should be sent directly to their wallets.
